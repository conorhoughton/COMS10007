\subsection*{3 Big Oh notation}

To recap, the definition of $O(g(n)$, called \lq{}big oh\rq{} of
$g(n)$, is
\begin{equation}
O(g(n))=\{f(n)| \exists n_0>0\in {\bf N}\mbox{ and }c>0\in {\bf R}\mbox{ with }|f(n)|\le c|g(n)|\,\forall n\ge n_0\}
\end{equation}
or, equivalently
\begin{equation}
f(n)\in O(g(n))\iff \lim_{n\rightarrow \infty}\frac{f(n)}{g(n)}<\infty
\end{equation}

In practice, if
\begin{equation}
T(n)=a_rn^r+a_{r-1}n^{r-1}+\ldots+a_1n+a_0
\end{equation}
then $T(n)\in O(n^r)$. 

As we saw, the logarithm has the funny property that it goes to infinity, but it
does so slower than $n$:
\begin{equation}
\lim_{n\rightarrow \infty}\frac{\log_2{n}}{n}=0
\end{equation}
Now, just as $\log_2{n}$ grows very slowly, $2^n$
grows very fast,
\begin{equation}
\lim_{n\rightarrow \infty}\frac{n^r}{2^n}=0
\end{equation}
for any finite value of $r$, worse still is $n!$, pronounced $n$-factorial
\begin{equation}
n!=n(n-1)(n-2) . . . 1
\end{equation}
If your algorithm is in $O(n!)$ you will probably need a different
algorithm. A table of different values is given as
Table~\ref{table_n_values}, mostly to emphasis how quickly $n!$ gets
big.

Now, in mathematics we call something \lq{}an abuse of notation\rq{}
if it is common to write something that doesn't quite make sense but
acts as a shorthand for something that does. Now $O(g(n))$ is a set of
functions whose large $n$ behavior is bounded by $g(n)$ so in
algorithms, being in $O(g(n))$ is a property of $T(n)$, the formula
for the running time of the algorithm. However, it is a standard abuse
of notation to say an algorithm is $O(g(n))$ for some $g(n)$ if
$T(n)\in O(g(n))$ for all cases. This is another way of saying that
the worst behavior of the algorithm isn't any worse than the behavior
of $g(n)$ for large $n$ so all possible $T(n)$ are elements of
$O(g(n))$. Finding $O(g(n))$ for an algorithm will be refered to as
\lq{}finding the big-oh complexity\rq{}. In the context of a more precise approach to the topic we might talk about \lq{}finding the asymptotic complexity\rq{}.

\vskip 1cm The website\\ {\tt

the $2^n$ calculations and\\ {\tt
  http://www.calculatorsoup.com/calculators/discretemathematics/factorials.php}\\ for
the $n!$ calculations; these give answers even when the answer is very
large. Another easy way to calculate with large numbers is to use Python.

\subsubsection*{Other big Letter notations, small oh notation.}

There is another set, $\Omega(g(n))$ with a definition similar to
$O(g(n))$ that is used for describing the best case behavior. This
requires a lower bound rather than an upper bound, so the obvious
definition is
\begin{equation}
\Omega(g(n))=\{f(n)| \exists n_0>0\in {\bf N}\mbox{ and }c>0\in {\bf R}\mbox{ with }|f(n)|\ge c|g(n)|\,\forall n\ge n_0\}
\end{equation}
or
\begin{equation}
f(n)\in \Omega(g(n))\iff \lim_{n\rightarrow \infty}\frac{f(n)}{g(n)}>0
\end{equation}
in other words, the same thing, but with the $\le$ symbol replaced by
a $\ge$. In fact, there is some ambiguity about this definition,
number theorists use a slightly different one. Either way, it isn't
used very often in computer science because algorithms are very
frequently $\Omega(1)$; in the best case scenario the problem is in
some sense already solved, the array already sorted for example, and
the algorithm finishes in one step. 

There is also a set of functions that are both bounded above and below
by the same $g(n)$
\begin{equation}
\Theta(g(n))=\Omega(g(n))\cap O(g(n))
\end{equation}
This works because it is possible for
\begin{equation}
c_1 g(n)\le f(n)\le c_2g(n)
\end{equation}
for different $c_1$ and $c_2$. It would be very unusual for this to
apply to an algorithm, it would mean that $T(n)$ has the same behavior
for large $n$ no matter whether it is the best case or the worst case
scenario. There is a na\"ive largest element function in
Table~\ref{c_largest_linear_search} which is $\Theta(n)$. It searches
for the largest value in an unsorted array by looking at each element
in turn. In fact, for a completely unsorted array this is the best
algorithm, but, in practice, if finding the largest element in a set
is an important and frequent procedure, a special data structure,
called a heap, is used to keep track of which element is largest.

\begin{table}
\begin{lstlisting}[numbers=left]
int search(int a[],int n)
{
   int i;
   int best_val=a[0];

   for(i=1;i<n;i++){
      if(a[i]>best_val)
         best_val= a[i];
   }

  return best_val;
}
\end{lstlisting}
\caption{Search for the largest element in an unsorted list. This
  function searches all the elements to see which is the largest, the
  inner loop always runs $n-1$ times since it doesn't know until it
  has looked at every element which is going to be the largest. This
  program is implemented as {\tt
    find\_largest.c}.\label{c_largest_linear_search}.}
\end{table}

Finally, little oh notation is a stricter version of big Oh notation
that is used in some more mathematical context, basically $f(n)\in
o(g(n))$ is $f(n)$ is greater than $cg(n)$ for any choice of $c$, if $n$
is large enough:
\begin{equation}
o(g(n))=\{f(n)| \exists n_0>0\in {\bf N}\mbox{ so that }|f(n)|>
c|g(n)|\,\forall n\ge n_0 \mbox{ and }\forall\,c>0\in {\bf R}\}
\end{equation}
